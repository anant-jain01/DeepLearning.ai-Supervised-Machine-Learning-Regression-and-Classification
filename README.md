# Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification – Applied Labs

This repository contains lab work and exercises completed as part of the **Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification** course by DeepLearning.AI, offered on Coursera and taught by Andrew Ng.

## 📘 Course Overview

This course introduces the foundational concepts of supervised machine learning, focusing on:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Gradient Descent
- Cost Functions
- Overfitting & Regularization
- Evaluation Metrics (e.g., Accuracy, Precision, Recall)

## 📁 Repository Contents

- `labs/` – Jupyter Notebooks for course labs and exercises
- `README.md` – Project overview and context
- `utils.py` (optional) – Custom helper functions (if used)

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn (for evaluation and comparison)

## 🎯 Learning Outcome

By completing this course and its labs, I’ve built a strong foundation in supervised learning techniques, implemented regression and classification models from scratch, and gained practical skills in evaluating model performance.

## ✅ Certificate

This project is part of the **Machine Learning Specialization** by DeepLearning.AI.
